Users can input a stock symbol and choose from several strategies, including simple moving averages (SMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and a combination of SMA with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and candlestick patterns. By leveraging these tools, users can identify potential buy or sell signals based on the selected indicators.
